    "## What is ABC?\n",
    "\n",
    "Like MCMC methods, ABC is an approach to <b>sampling posterior distributions</b>.  Throughout the course, we have started every problem with the following steps:\n",
    "1. Write down Bayes' theorem.\n",
    "2. Specify the likelihood and prior.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then go on to compute the posterior analytically, find the MAP estimate for the parameters, sample the posterior numerically, perform model selection, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "ABC takes a different route to approximate the posterior and can be thought of intuitively as a generative approach.  The idea is as follows:\n",
    "1. <b>Draw samples from the prior.</b>  For instance, if we used a uniform prior to describe the probability of worm reversal, we would draw random values $p$ in the interval [0, 1].\n",
    "2. <b>Generate simulated data using those samples.</b>  To analyze worm reversal, we would simulate $n$ trials with probability of success $p$ (the value we sampled above) and count the number of successes or reversals $r$.\n",
    "3. <b>Compare the simulated results to the observed data.</b>  If the trial above yields the same number of reversals as the experiment, the value $p$ is drawn from the posterior.\n",
    "4. <b>Keep samples from the <i>prior</i> that can give rise to the observed results, as they represent samples from the <i>posterior</i>.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "To be more precise, our goal is to sample the posterior $g \\left( \\theta \\mid D \\right)$, where $\\theta$ denotes the parameter(s) of interest and $D$ the data.  ABC then takes the following approach:\n",
    "1. Draw sample $\\theta^*$ from the prior $g \\left( \\theta \\right)$.\n",
    "2. Simulate data $D^*$ according to a generative likelihood $f \\left( D \\mid \\theta \\right)$.\n",
    "3. Check whether we have $D^* = D$.\n",
    "4. If the simulated results match the observed data, keep $\\theta^*$ as a sample from the posterior $g \\left( \\theta \\mid D \\right)$.  Repeat until the desired number of samples is drawn."

    "## What are the strengths of ABC?\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying principles of ABC can be readily understood in the framework of Bayesian inference. From the discussion above, ABC differs from our standard Bayesian inference primarily in the specification of the likelihood. <b>Its key advantage is that it does not require analytical formulation or evaluation of the likelihood.</b> Instead, ABC only requires a generative procedure for simulating results given sampled values of the parameter(s). In the course, we have always been able to specify a computationally tractable likelihood to model the data. ABC opens up the realm of possible models to include those that cannot be readily computed but can be simulated.\n",

(Only the first child was considered, to eliminate possible confounding effects from couples' stopping rules.)  The researchers were specifically interested in the effect of parental attractiveness, which was rated on a scale from 1 to 5.  Their finding was based on those individuals who were rated \"very attractive\" (5) by the interviewer, or 11.2%.  (Individuals also performed self-ratings but on a different scale, from 1 to 4.  28.2% rated themselves as \"very attractive.\")  Among these parents, the proportion of boys was 0.44.\n",

Therefore, we can simulate the number of male births by taking the results of $n = 333$ \"coin flips,\" each with probability $p$ of success.  This function is very simple.  I have included versions with and without [<tt>numba</tt>](https://numba.pydata.org/), which performs just-in-time compilation and gives a good speed boost.

    "However, the prior is intended to capture our actual knowledge about the parameter(s) of interest.  We don't actually think that the proportion of male births could be 0.1 or 0.95, for instance.  According to the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.BRTH.MF), there were 1.073 male births per female birth in 2017, meaning that the proportion of male births is about 0.5176.  We'll choose an informative prior that is peaked around this value, since the sex ratio has been quite similar for the past few decades."

    "With an uninformative prior, the median is simply the observed proportion of male births in the data, and the 97.5th percentile is still below 0.50.  With an informative prior, the observed data does shift the distribution, but the proportion of male births among very attractive people remains close to 0.50, as expected.  In both cases, we see good agreement of the samples with the analytical posterior distribution, showing that ABC accurately samples the posterior.  Do you believe that very attractive people are less likely to have boys?"

    "\n",
    "As we have seen here, ABC is relatively easy to implement and can sample posterior distributions well.  What are the limitations of this approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuous Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we simulated a univariate likelihood that gave rise to a discrete variable: $m$, the number of male births in $n$ births.  What if we were simulating a continuous variable?  In that case, it is essentially impossible that a simulated value will be *equal* to the observed one, and our acceptance rate would be 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we can simply accept samples where the simulated $D^*$ is \"close enough\" to $D$, often measured by Euclidean distance.  If we are stringent enough on that condition, the samples should still approximate the posterior well.  Of course, the trade off for accurate sampling is the computational inefficiency of a high rejection rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multivariate Likelihoods\n",
    "\n",
    "What if, instead of computing a single value $m$, our results $D$ consisted of 2, 20, or even 200 values?  It would be highly unlikely that every single value of a simulated result would equal the actual values in the observed data, whether discrete or continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative is to compute summary statistics on the actual data $D$ and the simulated results $D^*$, such as the mean, median, and variance.  If the summary statistics are close, then we accept that sample."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "ABC provides an intuitive way to perform Bayesian inference and is particularly useful for sampling the posterior distribution when the likelihood is difficult to formulate explicitly or compute efficiently.  Like any method, however, it is not necessarily suitable for every problem.  In particular, the tradeoff between accurate sampling and computational efficiency is highly problematic when simulated results are unlikely to be equal or close enough to observed data."
